// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

	DISPLAY "Enter two numbers and add them together"
	INPUT numbers
	 READ 8
	 WRITE 8
	 READ 12
	 WRITE 12
	 Sum <--8+12
	OUTPUT 20

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

	DISPLAY "Enter a number and check if it's even or odd"
	READ 7
	 IF num=even
	  THEN
	  OUTPUT "The number is even"
	 ELSE IF num=odd
	  THEN
	  OUTPUT "The number is odd"
	 ENDIF
	WRITE "7 is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

DECLARE an ARRAY of 5 integers (int)
 READ ARRAY(1,2,3,4,5)
DECLARE average (AVG) of 5 int listed
 AVG <--(1+2+3+4+5)/5
 WRITE 3
DECLARE minimum (min) and maximum (max) of 5 int listed
 READ ARRAY (1,2,3,4,5)
 MIN <--smallest int
 WRITE 1
 MAX <--largest int
 WRITE 5

The results for the average of five numbers is 3. AVG refers to average and INT refers to integer. WRITE 3 also means the output of 3, as in, the answer calculated by averaging the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 together.
The results for the minimum and maximum are 1 for minimim and 5 for maximum. MIN refers to the minimum and MAX refers to the maximum integer. WRITE and INT have the same meanings as listed above in the first explanation.
